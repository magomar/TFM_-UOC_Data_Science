Both CV and NLP are challenging fields themselves. While both fields share common techniques rooted in artificial intelligence and machine learning, they have historically developed separately, with little interaction between their scientific communities. However, recently there have been an upsurge of interest in problems that require a combination of linguistic and visual information. Besides, the rise of social media in the web has made available a vast amount of multimodal information, like tagged photographs, illustrations in newspaper articles, videos with subtitles, and multimodal feeds on social media..

To tackle combined language and vision tasks and to exploit the large amounts of multimodal information, the CV and NLP communities have been increasingly cooperating, for example by organizing combined workshops and conferences.
