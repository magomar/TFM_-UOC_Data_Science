\section{Future work}

Doing more hyper parameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of units, dropout rate, batch normalization etc.).

Use the cross validation set to understand overfitting.

Interleave validation as part of the training to detect overfitting

Use tensorboard visualization

Create an online image captioning application, for example using Tensorflow.js, to generate captions for images uploaded n the browser
